Objective
With verilog being compiled into bitstream, We utilize the ZYNQ PS Soc as our bootloader for the PL.
Flashing the bitstream to onboard flash we ensure the PL's feature will exit on every bootup.

### steps
 - create zynq ip block design, and configure it with relative QFlash and DDR configuration. 
 - Create Zynq HDL wrapper

 - Add PL side of application. In this case its breath led from previous project.

 - Add input and output wires into zynq block design wrapper and create breath_led instence

 - run synth.
 - configure io ports planning 
 - rerun synth and then run implementation
 - generate bit stream

 - Export File>Export>Hardware add bitstram and create handoff files.


- Lunch Xilinx SDK (File > SDK) SDK will load the hardware we just exported.

- New project application and create First Stage Bootloader (FSBL) for Zynq


- XILINX->Create Boot Image
